The corrected query uses a HAVING clause instead of a WHERE clause to filter the results based on the maximum value. The HAVING clause is used to filter aggregate results, while the WHERE clause filters individual rows before aggregation.  This ensures the aggregation is performed correctly before the filtering is applied.

```sql
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING AVG(price) >= (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products); 
```
