This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving the incorrect usage of aggregate functions (AVG(), MAX()) within WHERE clauses and subqueries. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version. The error arises from attempting to compare a single value (returned by MAX()) against a set of rows in the main query. The solution involves restructuring the query to correctly utilize the aggregate functions and avoid unintended comparisons.
